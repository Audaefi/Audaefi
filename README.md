<h3 align="left"> A passionate Data Engineer</h3>
I started my intent of becoming a data engineer because I was attracted to handling big data, discovering various insights, and solving business problems.
  <br>
  <br>
While working as a freelancer engineer at a legal-tech startup, I have experience in collaborating with in-house IP attorneys, paralegals and providing capabilities such as building data pipelines and analyzing data so that they can focus on IP strategies.
