<h3 align="left"> A passionate Data Engineer</h3>
Hello, I started my dream of becoming a data engineer because I discovered a variety of insights from numerous data and was attracted to solving business problems.

While working as a freelancer engineer at a legal-tech startup, I have experience in collaborating with in-house IP attorneys, paralegals and providing capabilities such as building data pipelines and analyzing data so that they can focus on IP strategies.
